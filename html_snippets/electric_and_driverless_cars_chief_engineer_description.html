<p>As the Chief Engineer, I was responsible for ensuring that every component of the car has the best possible design and they also have a proper interface between each other. Beside this, I was also in charge of finishing with the cars on time. We followed the traditional V-model during this project. We went through the concept, design, manufacturing and assembling phases in order and then we maintained both an electic and an autonomour racecar and participated in international racing events.</p>
