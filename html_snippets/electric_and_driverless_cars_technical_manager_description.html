<p>As the technical manager, I was responsible for either coming up with new technical processes that will make the team's operation more effective, or finding the bottlenecks of our already existing processes and optimizing them. We followed the traditional V-model during this project. We went through the concept, design, manufacturing and assembling phases in order and then we maintained both an electic and an autonomour racecar and participated in international racing events.</p>
